use the code.c get the height of each LEVEL 
code explanation :-
It generates a sequence of 30 random numbers between 0 and 15 (inclusive) using the rand() function, 
which returns a pseudo-random integer between 0 and RAND_MAX.
The srand(time(NULL)) function is used to seed the random number generator with the current time, 
ensuring that the sequence of numbers generated is different each time the program is run.
The for loop iterates 30 times, and for each iteration, 
it prints the index (i.e., i) and a random number between 0 and 15 using the printf() function.
Overall, the program generates a sequence of 30 random numbers and prints them to the console,along with their corresponding index.
