open the terminal run the commands as follows :
wget https://mercury.picoctf.net/static/5a487444509cda729298be7bce4bd96c/main.wav
python3 // opening python sentence by sentence compiler 
from scipy.io import wavfile
data=wavfile.read("main.wav")
print(data)
import numpy as np
print(np.unique(data[1]))
x=[y/100 for y in data[1]]
print(x)
x=[y//100//5-2 for y in data[1]]
print(x)
import string
string.hexdigits
'0123456789abcdefABCDEF'
y=[string.hexdigits[j] for j in x]
print(y)
z=''.join(y)
print(z)
bytearray.fromhex(z).decode()

This code does the following:

The first line uses the wget command to download a file called "main.wav" from a URL.
The second line starts a Python interpreter.
The third line imports the wavfile module from the scipy.io library and uses it to read the contents of the "main.wav" file. The contents are stored in the data variable.
The fourth line prints the contents of the data variable.
The fifth line imports the numpy library as np and prints the unique values in the second element of the data variable.
The sixth line creates a new list x by dividing each element in the second element of the data variable by 100.
The seventh line creates another new list x by dividing each element in the second element of the data variable by 100, then integer dividing by 5, and then subtracting 2.
The eighth line imports the string library and prints the hex digits defined in it.
The ninth line creates a new list y by mapping each element in x to its corresponding hex digit in the string.hexdigits string.
The tenth line joins the elements in the y list to create a new string z.
The eleventh line creates a bytearray from the hex string z and then decodes it to obtain the original data.
