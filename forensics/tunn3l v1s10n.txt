The challenge provides a hint to use a tool called "Bless Hex Editor" to examine the file and discover the flag.
Using Bless Hex Editor, we can see that the file contains some corrupted bytes.
 By researching the BMP file format and examining the file in the editor, 
 we can identify the specific bytes that need to be corrected to recover the flag.
First, we need to change the offset info header to 36 and 0B to 00. 
Then, we need to change the offset info header to 38 and 0B to 00. 
These changes will enable us to open the file, but the flag is still not visible.
Next, we need to change the height of the bitmap from 01 to 03. 
This makes the flag somewhat visible, but it is still difficult to read.
Finally, we need to increase the size of the image by changing "32" to "42". 
This makes the flag clearly visible
