search for the minirsa under the section cryptography in picoctf
then download ciphertext and paste the numbers in the code mini.py 

code explanation:-
The code uses the "Crypto.Util.number" library to perform a calculation that finds the integer value of a given expression with a large integer value. 
It defines three variables, "n", "e", and "c", representing parts of the equation.
It then defines a function, "find_invpow", that takes two arguments, an integer value "x" and a positive integer value "n".
The function calculates the inverse power of "x" to the nth degree.
Next, the program enters a loop that attempts to find a flag by iterating through a range of values for "i". 
It calculates the inverse power of "i * n + c" to the "e"th degree using the "find_invpow" function, converts it to bytes using the "long_to_bytes" function and 
checks if the resulting bytes contain the substring "pico".
If it does, the flag is printed along with the value of "i". 
If the flag is not found, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop by incrementing "i" by 1.

Then run the code in vscode or from the ubuntu terminal 
it will print the flag and earn you 300 points.
